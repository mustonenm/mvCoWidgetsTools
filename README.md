# mappView-compound-widgets-editor-
B&amp;R toolkit for editing mappView compound widgets in graphical editor

We have developed an unofficial open source toolkit for "mappView - Compound Widgets". Toolkit is written with Python.
Main idea came because we are currently lacking the graphical editor for editing compound widgets and we bumped into a task where editing widgets graphically was needed.

Python scripts basically transfer the "widgets" information between compound widgets library and autogenerated mappView content --> like described in our help:

**How to use the toolkit [sample project]:**
1. Open provided sample project from github

2. Follow instructions on following video:
   [How To use scripts video](https://github.com/mustonenm/mvCoWidgetsTools/blob/main/Logical/Scripts/CompoundWidgetsToolkit/HowToUseScripts.mp4)
   or
   watch from the project:

**How to use the toolkit [scripts]:**

1. Copy the scripts from sample project to your automation studio project. and make sure you have the required Python libraries installed..

2. Check project settings from Settings.json

3. Execute script: ReadWidgetsToVisu.py --> this will process the compound widgets in the project to a "CompoundWidgetsPage" in a mappView.

4. Now you may edit widgets graphically in mappView as you want and save when ready. *Do not rename the actual contents that have been autogenerated!*

5. Execute script: SaveWidgetsToLibrary.py --> this will wrap the "CompoundWidgetsPages" in a mappView back to Compound widgets in a library.

Just in case, make sure that you have your project backed up or in the source control system, before using this toolkit.
